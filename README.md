Made in AutoCad to solve the problem 
of light bleeding through the top of a blackout curtain.

Print at 400% size. This is a durable model.
I have 2 of these suckers drilled into my wall blocking about 90% of the light bleed.
Personal usage green lighted if you got a printer let me know if you need any help.
I printed using PLA or PLA+.

Enjoy.

IMPORTANT: INSTALL CURTAIN ROD ONTO THE FIRST HANGER BEFORED RILLING THE SECOND HANGER INTO THE WALL, 
OR YOU WONT BE ABLE TO SLIDE THE CURTAIN ROD INTO THE HANGER HOLES,
DEPENDING ON PLACEMENT, PROBABLY.
