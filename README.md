Made in AutoCad to solve the problem 
of light bleeding through the top of a blackout curtain.

Print at 400% size. This is a durable model.
I have 2 of these suckers drilled into my wall - game changers. 
Go ahead and print let me know if you need any help,
Mine are printed from PLA or PLA+.

Enjoy.

IMPORTANT: INSTALL CURTAIN ROD ONTO THE FIRST HANGER BEFOREDRILLING THE SECOND HANGER INTO THE WALL, 
OR YOU WONT BE ABLE TO SLIDE THE CURTAIN ROD INTO THE HANGER HOLES,
DEPENDING ON PLACEMENT, PROBABLY.
